# AOR 5357-23 Unit 102 v1 — PWA (Build v8)

Visible badge added under the title: **Build v8**. If you don't see it after upload, the app is still serving an older cached version.

## Upload steps
1. Create a public repo (e.g., aor-observation-report).
2. Upload ALL files from this zip to the repo root (index.html, manifest.webmanifest, sw.js, icons/).
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / (root). Save.
4. Open your site. You should see the badge: "Build v8 — … UTC".
5. On iPad Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.

## If you still see the old version
- Delete the app from your home screen, then re-add.
- In Safari → Settings → Advanced → Website Data → search for your GitHub Pages domain and Remove.
- Refresh the page twice. The version badge must read "Build v8".
