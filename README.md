# AOR 5357-23 Unit 102 v1 — PWA (Build v14: Closest Obs only)

- Selecting criteria under a photo now ticks **only the Obs box on the exact row** for that criterion.
- It never touches WT/PE/OTJ columns.
- If the code appears more than once, it ticks the **first occurrence** in reading order (closest to the question).
- Badge shows: "Build v14 — … (Closest-Obs Only)".
