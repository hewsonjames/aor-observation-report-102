# AOR 5357-23 Unit 102 v1 — PWA (Export + Save Fix, Dual Signatures)

## What's in this build
- **Top header**: Applying Health, Safety & Environmental Considerations + inputs
- **Dual signature boxes** (Assessor & Learner) + name inputs
- **Save Draft**: persists all inputs, ticks, photos, captions, selected criteria, and both signatures
- **Export as PDF (fix)**: converts text inputs & checkboxes to static text and embeds signatures in the printout
- Prevents the page from moving while signing
